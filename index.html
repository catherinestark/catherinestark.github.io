          <p>I'm from Woods Hole, Massachusetts. </p>

    <p>Here at Yale, I do a variety of things! I'm in the concert band and marching band. I'm also student tech. I waste a lot of time on the internet. And... homework. Sometimes. </p>

    <p>I'm currently in love with Nutella. And Greek yogurt. Not together though. Actually that'd probably be a pretty good combination.</p>
